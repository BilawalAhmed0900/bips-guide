# Why
The guide over [github/bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) are truly vague for beginners trying to understand them. That is why I am writting this guide of the BIPS that I had to personally understand for some project. Hope you find them useful.

 - [BIP0039](bip39.md) (generating of phrases)
 - [BIP0032](bip32.md) (definition of HD wallets)
 - [BIP0044](bip44.md) (one specific implementation of BIP0032)
